Flash Socket Policy Server
http://www.lightsphere.com/dev/articles/flash_socket_policy.html
----------------

This is a simple Perl script that listens on port 843 and returns a Socket Policy XML string for Flash players. (See http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/articles/fplayer9_security_04.html for details.)

You will need root access to run this script. To start the script:

./socketpolicy.pl > /dev/null &

You'll also want to add it to your rc.local or other startup script so that it restarts after a system reboot.

Restricting Ports:
------------------
The script currently allows Flash Players to access any socket on the server, from any domain. To limit to certain ports or domains, change the values in xml_policy.

Allowable formats for to-ports: 
*                   all ports
port1,port2,port3   a list of ports
port1-port20        a range of ports

Allowable formats for domain:
*                   all domains
domain1,domain2     specific domains

See http://www.adobe.com/xml/schemas/PolicyFileSocket.xsd for the policy file schema.

Note on Logging:
----------------
This script does some basic logging of connections. It overwrites the log every time it starts. If you want to append to the log, change this line:

    open(LOG, ">$logfile") or warn "Can't open $logfile: $!\n";

to this:

    open(LOG, ">>$logfile") or warn "Can't open $logfile: $!\n";

If you'd prefer to turn off logging, change $should_be_logging to 0.
